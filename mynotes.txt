1 - Check the eslint.config.mjs because I excluded the other modules(not mine, like prisma...)
maybe I should keep or not.
2 - Maybe regenerate the secret with 
redouane@Mac prostore % openssl rand -base64 32
9RXWAii85B6Cl5JL7bjVw+AGMlmIZhREmPsjVgkdaVU=
and copy the new one to the NEXTAUTH_SECRET variable?
